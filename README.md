# Repository Title (e.g., Web-Application-Security-Labs)

A collection of labs demonstrating my skills in web application security, vulnerability analysis, and secure database practices.

## Labs Included

* **Web Application Security:** Practiced identifying and mitigating common vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLi.
* **Session Management:** Analyzed and secured session handling mechanisms to prevent hijacking.
* **Database Security:** Implemented secure configurations and query practices for SQL databases.
* **Source Code Analysis:** Performed static analysis on web application code to find security flaws.

## Skills & Tools Demonstrated

* **Tools:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, sqlmap, Nmap
* **Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Insecure Deserialization
* **Techniques:** Source code review, traffic analysis, penetration testing, session token analysis
* **Concepts:** Secure Coding Principles, Database Hardening, Input Validation

## What I Learned

In this series of labs, I learned how to move from basic vulnerability scanning to in-depth manual analysis of a web application. The most challenging part was [mention a challenge, e.g., "performing blind SQL injection"], which I overcame by [mention the method, e.g., "using time-based queries"]. This project solidified my understanding of the OWASP Top 10.
